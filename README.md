# Flower Prediction Project

This repository contains code and resources for predicting flower species using machine learning techniques. The project is implemented in a Jupyter notebook and aims to classify different types of flowers based on their features.

## Repository Structure

- **`flower_prediction.ipynb`**: A Jupyter notebook that provides a step-by-step implementation of a flower classification model.
- **Data**: The dataset used for training and evaluating the model. The dataset includes features such as petal length, petal width, sepal length, and sepal width, along with the target label representing the flower species.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or later
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries:
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Scikit-Learn
  - Matplotlib
  - TensorFlow/Keras (optional, if using deep learning)

You can install the necessary libraries by running:
```sh
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib tensorflow
```

### Running the Notebook

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the repository directory:
   ```sh
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook flower_prediction.ipynb
   ```
4. Follow the steps in the notebook to train and evaluate the model on the provided dataset.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to classify different types of flowers based on their physical characteristics. This project utilizes machine learning techniques to train a model that can accurately predict the species of a flower given its features.

### Key Steps:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Load and preprocess the dataset, handle missing values, and normalize features.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extract meaningful features that help in improving model performance.
- **Model Training**: Train machine learning models such as logistic regression, decision trees, or neural networks to predict the flower species.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the trained model using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

## Example Results

The notebook includes examples of predictions made by the model, along with visualizations to help understand the model's performance. For instance, confusion matrices and accuracy scores are used to evaluate how well the model performs on the test data.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have suggestions for improving the code or adding new features, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
